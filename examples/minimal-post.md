title: 'Minimal Example Post'

# Hello WordPress!

This is the absolute minimum required for a post. Only the `title` field is required in frontmatter.

Everything else uses defaults:

- Status: `draft` (from config or default)
- Slug: Auto-generated from title
- No tags or categories

## Try It

```bash
pnpm cli publish examples/minimal-post.md --dry-run
```
